VLTEdit
-------

This repository contains VLTEdit, a program used to make mods for Need For Speed: Most Wanted (2005).
VLTEdit was made by 'Arushan', but he kind of disappeared...

I (MWisBest) decided it was time his tools got some updating, or at the very least get some source code for them.
VLTEdit was written in C#, so it wasn't difficult to decompile it using ILSpy, however Arushan obfuscated it using Dotfuscator. I've deobfuscated some of it, but there's still more to go.
